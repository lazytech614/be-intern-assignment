## Database Schema Design

This document describes the database schema and relationships for the backend application using TypeORM.

---

### Users

- **Table:** `users`
- **Columns:**
  - `id`: Primary key
  - `firstName`: String
  - `lastName`: String
  - `email`: String (unique)
  - `createdAt`: Timestamp
  - `updatedAt`: Timestamp

- **Relationships:**
  - One-to-Many with `Post` (a user can create many posts)
  - Many-to-Many with `Users` for followers/followings (via `follow` join table)
  - One-to-Many with `Like` (a user can like many posts)
  - One-to-Many with `Activity` (a user can have many activities)

---

### Post

- **Table:** `post`
- **Columns:**
  - `id`: Primary key
  - `authorId`: Foreign key to `Users`
  - `content`: Text
  - `createdAt`: Timestamp
  - `updatedAt`: Timestamp

- **Relationships:**
  - Many-to-One with `Users` (each post has one author)
  - Many-to-Many with `Hashtag` (posts can have multiple hashtags via `post_hashtag` join table)
  - One-to-Many with `Like` (a post can have many likes)

---

### Like

- **Table:** `like`
- **Columns:**
  - `userId`: Primary key, foreign key to `Users`
  - `postId`: Primary key, foreign key to `Post`
  - `createdAt`: Timestamp

- **Relationships:**
  - Many-to-One with `Users`
  - Many-to-One with `Post`

---

### Hashtag

- **Table:** `hashtag`
- **Columns:**
  - `id`: Primary key
  - `tag`: String (unique)

- **Relationships:**
  - Many-to-Many with `Post` (hashtags can be attached to many posts)

---

### Activity

- **Table:** `activity`
- **Columns:**
  - `id`: Primary key
  - `userId`: Foreign key to `Users`
  - `type`: Enum (`POST_CREATED`, `LIKED`, `FOLLOWED`, `UNFOLLOWED`)
  - `referenceId`: Integer (could be a `postId`, `userId`, etc.)
  - `createdAt`: Timestamp

- **Relationships:**
  - Many-to-One with `Users`
  - Many-to-One with `Post` (nullable, only used when `type` is `POST_CREATED`)

## Entity Relationship Diagram (Simplified)

## Indexing Strategy

To ensure performance and fast lookups, several indexes are defined:

### Indexed Columns

| Table     | Columns              | Description                        |
|-----------|----------------------|------------------------------------|
| Users     | `email`              | For quick email lookups (unique)   |
| Post      | `author`, `createdAt`| For filtering and sorting by date  |
| Hashtag   | `tag`                | For unique hashtag constraint      |

### Composite Indexes

- `Post (author, createdAt)` â€“ speeds up queries like fetching recent posts from a specific user.

### Additional Notes

- The join table for `Users` following other `Users` (`follow`) implicitly benefits from the join indexes generated by TypeORM.
- The composite primary key in the `Like` entity (`userId`, `postId`) ensures a user cannot like the same post twice and makes lookups efficient.

## Optimization Suggestions

- **Pagination:** Use cursor-based pagination for large datasets (e.g., in feed or activity logs).
- **Caching:** Popular queries (e.g., trending hashtags, most liked posts) can be cached.
- **Search:** For advanced search capabilities, consider integrating with Elasticsearch.
